# **Ricardo I. Alcalá Briseño Ph.D.**

I'm a viral ecologist working at Penn State in the Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology [PPEM](https://plantpath.psu.edu/). My research focuses on the distribution of plant and fungal viromes across natural and agricultural ecosystems, and on understanding their ecological functions alongside the epidemiological dimensions of disease. I am interested in understanding mixed virus infections and how these interactions shape virome communities and influence pathogen emergence in natural systems. My work centers on developing tools and conceptual frameworks to study complex datasets centered on interactions, integrating virome network analysis that combines viral metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics with machine-learning methods and [bipartite] network analysis. I synthesize these patterns using concepts from island biogeography, community ecology, and disease ecology to understand how viromes are structure accros spaces, host and ecosystem.


> Education: I obtained a Ph.D. from the [Plant Pathology Department](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/), the [Emerging Pathogen Institute](https://www.epi.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu), and the  [Institute of Food Systems, now Global Food Systems Institute](https://foodsystems.ifas.ufl.edu/), supervised by Professor [Karen A. Garrett](https://twitter.com/garret_lab). I did a Postdoctoral Study in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology at Oregon State University.

# **Ricardo I. Alcalá Briseño**
I'm an Assistant Professor of Viral Ecology at Penn State University. I work with plant and fungal viruses in natural ecosystems and agricultural systems. 


Past experiences
I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Plant Pathology Department](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/), [Institute of Food Systems](http://isfs.institute.ifas.ufl.edu/), and the [Emerging Pathogen Institute](https://www.epi.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). I am developing a framework for the analysis of complex viromes in the agroecological landscape supervised by [Karen A. Garrett](https://twitter.com/garret_lab), Preeminent Professor and AAAS fellow. The goal of my dissertation was to assess the virome ecological dynamics in crop systems and its translation to virome management strategies.
I have interested in understanding host-virus interactions, and my long-term goal is to understand virome community assemblage and mechanisms of pathogen emergence in nature. I am developing tools and frameworks for the analysis of complex data sets. I am currently developing a network analysis framework for the study of viral metagenomic sequences, implementing machine learning methods and meta-transcriptomics for sequence quantification. The resulting information is analyzed using a bipartite network analysis combining concepts of island biogeography and community ecology.
