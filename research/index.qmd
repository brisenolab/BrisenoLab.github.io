I am a viral ecologist at Penn State University in the Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology ([PPEM](https://plantpath.psu.edu/)). My research focuses on the distribution of plant and fungal viromes across natural and agricultural ecosystems, and on understanding their ecological functions alongside the epidemiological dimensions of disease.

I am particularly interested in mixed virus infections and how these interactions shape virome communities and influence pathogen emergence in natural systems. My work centers on developing tools and conceptual frameworks for the analysis of complex interaction-driven datasets, integrating virome network analysis that combines viral metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics with machine-learning approaches and bipartite network analysis.

I synthesize these patterns using concepts from island biogeography, community ecology, and disease ecology to understand how viromes are structured across space, hosts, and ecosystems.
